            <p>We are a pair, one who has opened up 4-5 startups and other who has completely delved into technical challenges of startups. And both of us had painful experiences before we witnessed success. When we met and discussed about it, we realized that our pain-points are also faced by many but not everyone knows how to get past them. So we decided to share our knowledge with people. People who are looking to start their own idea with passion but donâ€™t know where and how to begin, like we once did. There are certain challenges which are common to just any aspect of business but how to tackle them remains obscure. We decided that we will do a seminar to tell people what we did not do or what we should have done. We tell them what the beginning steps should be and provide answers to problems which people might not even think they happen, but they do happen! What we get from this (apart from the seminar fee), is to meet people with new ideas which in itself is a reward. See you at the seminar.</p>
