            <p>When somebody thinks of an idea he or she is really positive about converting that into a successful business. Starting a business has its own challenges and solutions to those might be available but not the method to approach those solutions. And so the unavailability of such kind of guidance leads to the horrific number - 9 out of 10 fail. </p>
            <p>We are a team, and we have witnessed a fair share of startup techniques which we decided to share through this seminar. We have built a few running startups and dealt with core needs of technology behind those. When we sit and discuss amongst us about pains we faced and methods we used to resolve them, it clicked to us that these methods are reusable. There are lesser known facts, undocumented, which we try to bring forward through this seminar hoping that it can help people take their right first step. And finally what we get out of this is the fulfilment of our vision - <span class="highlight">help startups take a right path</span> giving them a guided headstart.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight bold">Sonu Bajaj</span>, the speaker of this seminar, has created startups from scratch and who knows literally all aspects of business - marketing, finance, technology, customer relations and much more. Sonu has created successful ventures of nothing and in the process he learnt a lot. He is a determined doer and over time has developed strong ethics towards business which help him take correct decisions. Having awesome presentation and guiding skills, he believes himself to be a person who can create and enhance values in others. Apart from his professional dealings, he loves reading books, spending time with his cute daughter and baking new ideas from oven.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight bold">Abhishek Sharma</span> is the technologist who gives birth to a product from its aspects of design and technology . He has seen failing servers, last minute code disruptions, dealing with third party developers and process of learning bleeding edge technologies fast to make things happen faster. He has been part of core team in two startups one of which turned into a successful acquisition of <span class="italics">20 million dollars</span>. The one thing setting him apart from the league is his high communication bandwidth which helps him understand needs of everyone. His skills are perfectly optimized for a nascent stage startup, and when he is not working he chats to his friends, sings some song from them and spends his time reading. </p>
