            <br/><br/>
            <p>When somebody thinks of an idea he or she is really positive about converting that into a successful business. Starting a business has its own challenges and solutions to those might be available but not the method to approach those solutions. And so the unavailability of such kind of guidance leads to the horrific number - 9 out of 10 fail. </p>
            <p>We are a team, and we have witnessed a fair share of startup techniques which we decided to share through this seminar. We have built a few running startups and dealt with core needs of technology behind those. When we sit and discuss amongst us about pains we faced and methods we used to resolve them, it clicked to us that these methods are reusable. There are lesser known facts, undocumented, which we try to bring forward through this seminar hoping that it can help people take their right first step. And finally what we get out of this is the fulfilment of our vision - <span class="highlight">help startups take a right path</span> giving them a guided headstart.</p>
